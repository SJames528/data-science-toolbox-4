### Shellcode
We can try to include shellcode as one of the programming languages: https://www.google.com/search?q=shellcode&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab

  - where some scripts which e.g. weaponise pdfs will contain raw shellcode within them.
  - and relate this to the  "kill chain" in IMCS

Here's a big repo of shellcode: http://shell-storm.org/
